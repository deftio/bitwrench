## Welcome to bitwrench.js (alpha not fully released yet)

(c) 2012- manu chatterjee 


bitwrench is a javascript library for useful functions such as:


* HTML quick emits -- create a sortable table from a 2d array, create tabs, create HTML documents declaratively
* color conversions and interpolation
* setting/getting cookies   
* a better typeof operator  
* pretty printing json
* saving/loading application data files (works in both browser or node)
* getting URL parameters with defaults
* some data manipulation functions and other "random" things (interpolation, clipping, multi-d arrays, random())
* logging with dissolve (bw.log, bw.logd, bw.logExport)
* built-in docString support


There is no great structure here, just a bunch of kitchen sink things that seemed to be handy in alot of quick web dev situations.    All non-dom specific calls can be run either server side or client side.

Of course your mileage may very..

A minified form bitwrench.min.js is provided with identical functionality

## Usage 

### node.js
```
#Installation (server side)  
npm install bitwrench --save 

//usage in nodejs
var bw = require('./bitwrench.js')["bw"];  //adds to current scope

```

### browser

```
//usage in browser
<script type="text/javascript" src="./bitwrench.min.js"></script>

<script>
console.log(bw.version());  // print bitwrench.js version installed
</script>
```
