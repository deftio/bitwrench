## Welcome to bitwrench.js (alpha not fully released yet)

bitwrench is a javascript library for useful demo hacking and misc kitchen sink operations.  Use it for throwing up quick web pages which don't depend on any server side framework but need a little prettyifcation or for visualizing quick data.  For example when debugging C/C++ embedded projects where we don't want to clutter the build dirs with lots of "weird web stuff" - just write a simple HTML page with bitwrench and still load/debug raw text files, JSON, arrays and other bits of embedded files with no extra dependancies.


* **HTML quick emits** -- create HTML objects either client or server side from pure JSON.  useful for making quick components or dynamic content w/o any inline HTML
	* html(["div", {class:"class1 class2", onclick:"myFunction(this)","This is the content"}] 
	* DOM selects and applies e.g. 
		* bw.DOM("h3","tada") // set all <h3> tags to have the content "tada"
		* bw.DOM(".myClass",function(x){... do something on each element described by CSS selector .myClass})
	* supports "deep" hieararchical JSON constructs and arrays
	* registerFunction abilities allow functions to be passed statically to HTML elements (see docs)
	* Useful as a "onefile" framework which an interpret rich JSON in to full web pages.  
* **Color conversions and interpolation**
	* RGB, RGBa, HSL, HSLa, and theme generation both as numeric values also as CSS outputs
* **setting/getting cookies**   
* **pretty printing json**
* **Saving/Loading application data files** (works in both browser or node)
	* save / load files as raw or JSON 
* **Getting URL parameters with defaults**
	* simple parsing of URL params, also can be  used for command line scripts
* **Data manipulation functions** and other "random" things (interpolation, clipping, multi-d arrays, random())
* **Logging** with time-stamps, messaging, and pretty printing (raw, HTML, and text) 
	* Logging also has auto dissolve so one can log a process and then dump later or suppress in 'production'
* **Built-in docString parsing** with extraction support 
	* bitwrench.js self-documents in that from the browser DOM one can pull out a given function's doc strings such as bw.docString("DOM") ==> gives docString inforfor that function.
	* note that bitwrench.min.js strips comments so built-in help is not available.


There is no great structure here, just a bunch of kitchen sink things that seemed to be handy in alot of quick web dev situations.    All non-dom specific calls can be run either server side or client side.

A minified form bitwrench.min.js is provided with identical functionality

## Usage 
See the quick docs here:
[bitwrench quick docs](./quick-docs.html)

or examples here:
[bitwrench examples](./examples)

### node.js
```bash
#Installation (server side)  
npm install bitwrench --save 
```

```javascript
//usage in nodejs
var bw = require('./bitwrench.js');  //adds to current scope
var s = bw.html(["div",{"class":"foo"},"This is some  HTMLE"]); // now... ===> s = "<div class='foo'>This is some HTMLE</div>

```

### browser
In the browser bitwrench is loaded like any script library.  Note that parameters can be passed to bitwrench to control the loading process.
```html
//usage in browser
<script type="text/javascript" src="./bitwrench.min.js"></script>

<script>
console.log(bw.version());  // print bitwrench.js version installed
</script>
```
 

## Source code home  
all source is at github:  
[bitwrench on github](http://github.com/deftio/bitwrench)  


## Linting 
bitwrench uses eslint for static code checking and analysis.

```bash
npm install eslint --save-dev

./node_modules/.bin/eslint --init

```
Now run the lint test like this:
```bash
./node_modules/.bin/eslint bitwrench.js   
```

## Tests  (requires mocha and chai test suites)  
bitwrench is tested with the mocha framework installed locally using npm

```bash
npm install mocha --save-dev mocha

```

Run the tests as follows:
```bash
./node_modules/mocha/bin/mocha test/bitwrench_test.js --reporter spec

```
